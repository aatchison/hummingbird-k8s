# Rust CLI (work in progress — epic [#279])

The bash client-side tooling under [`../scripts/`](../scripts/) is being
rewritten in Rust over several phases. See [`rust/README.md`](../rust/README.md)
for the workspace layout and the epic for the architectural plan.

## Operator-facing status (today)

**No operator-facing change yet.** All `make deploy-cluster`, `make
update-cluster`, `make destroy-cluster`, `make verify-*`, etc. continue to
invoke the existing bash scripts. The Rust workspace at `../rust/` is a
foundation; subcommands land per the phasing table in
[`rust/README.md`](../rust/README.md).

## Foundation status

| Sub-issue | What | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| [#280](https://github.com/aatchison/hummingbird-k8s/issues/280) | Devcontainer + cargo workspace skeleton | landed (PR #313) |
| [#281](https://github.com/aatchison/hummingbird-k8s/issues/281) | CI workflow (fmt / clippy / test / deny / pre-commit / devcontainer smoke / lint inheritance) | landed (PR #314) |
| [#282](https://github.com/aatchison/hummingbird-k8s/issues/282) | `ClusterConfig` parser (first real crate) | this PR |
| [#283](https://github.com/aatchison/hummingbird-k8s/issues/283) | clap command tree (binary crate) | pending (gated on foundation) |
| [#284](https://github.com/aatchison/hummingbird-k8s/issues/284) | virt + `qemu+ssh` URI transport | pending |
| [#285](https://github.com/aatchison/hummingbird-k8s/issues/285) | openssh transport | pending |

## Foundation crates landed so far

| Crate | Purpose | Tracked by |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `hbird-common` | Workspace bootstrap placeholder (project constants). | [#280] |
| `hbird-config` | Typed parser for `cluster.local.conf`. | [#282] |

## When the Rust binary will appear in the `Makefile`

Per the operator-mental-model contract in the epic, the `Makefile` will
dispatch to either the Rust binary or the bash equivalent on a per-target
basis. The first dispatch lands when [#286] (`update-cluster`) reaches
behavioral parity — error formatting, log shape, and exit codes
indistinguishable from the bash twin against the same cluster.

Until then this doc is a stub; the migration guide lands at
`docs/rust-migration.md` per [#291] once at least one subcommand has
switched dispatch.

## How to verify behavioral parity (Phase 1 onward)

The contract: run both the Rust binary and the bash script against the
same cluster + diff `kubectl`/`virsh` state at each step. The harness for
that lives outside this doc until [#286] formalizes it.
